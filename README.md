## Navigating the Website

The website is made to be dynamic and as such the UI mockups need to be viewed by filtering through the dummy data within the website.

**Please note there are only emails between the date range 2019/12/31 - 2020/1/3 so filter accordingly!**

Dummy JSON data has been created based on the UI mockups provided.

### `No Results UI`

To get to this UI please either enter an **INVALID** date range **OR** nothing in the date range input.

### `Desktop UI`

To get to this UI to match the one in the mockup please filter by the date range **2019/12/31 - 2020/1/3**.

Then click on the **Date** header and hover the cursor over the correct email row.

**NOTE** Clicking the headers will bold the columns and their data!!
